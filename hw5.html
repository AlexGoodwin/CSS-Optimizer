		<li>An IaaS is preferable to a PaaS in situations where you need more control over your application or system. For example, if you require a certain level of security that cannot be trusted to a third party, or need to be able to modify low-level settings on the fly and without restriction. IaaS also allows for more custom growth and scaling, whereas PaaS are restricted to how that platform has been set up. Ironically, one of the best times to employ an IaaS is when building a PaaS or SaaS- for example, when building a competitor to Heroku, it would be far more cost-effective to build it on IaaS servers, rather than taking the cost of setup, maintenance, and hardware on alone.</li>

		<li>Not all software is ideal for the cloud- in fact, much software is built specifically to reside on a local machine, and cannot be utilized effectively across internet lines. For example, local file access and authentication is significantly faster and more efficient locally. In addition, there are also security and reliability concerns with moving software to the cloud. What happens if the cloud service goes down? Gets hacked? There are many industries (health, war, etc) that cannot afford to take those risks, and it therefore does not make sense for them to be hosted remotely.</li>
