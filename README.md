# Methods
=======
This Repository contains code for our Fall 2014 CSCI 3308 Software Methods & Tools project, the CSS-Optimizer. This webapp removes excess kludge and improves the order of your CSS.

## Organization
The main webapp files are contained in the root directory of the repository. Static resources like the site's CSS, Javascript and images. Results of CSS files submitted to the webapp for compression are put into the results directory.

## Documentation
Our automatic documentation is made using doxygen.  The documentation can be generated by running the command `doxygen opticonfig`.

## Unit Testing
Details of unit tests are contained in the `report.pdf` file.  Code is hosted online at [AlexGoodwinMedia.com/CSS](www.alexgoodwinmedia.com/CSS)

## Development
The development webserver is contained in the MAMP-Stack.  It can be obtained at [This Link](www.mamp.info)
